            <p>I'm Affan Ahmed Ali, a passionate engineer with a strong foundation in Machine Learning, Data Engineering, and Automation. I enjoy solving real-world problems using intelligent systems, and I’ve applied this across domains—whether building RAG-based AI assistants, automating ETL pipelines, or creating QA tools for network devices.</p>
            <p>With a background in Computer Systems Engineering from NED University and hands-on experience at companies like Systellex and Data N Dashboards, I've developed scalable solutions using Python, PyTorch, Airflow, and modern web stacks like MERN and Next.js.</p>
